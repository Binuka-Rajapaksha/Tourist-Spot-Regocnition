## Project Description

Tourism significantly impacts the global economy, yet travelers often face challenges in 
identifying and understanding attractions due to lack of real-time information. This project 
presents the development of "2rism", a web application aimed at addressing this issue. By 
utilizing machine learning and deep learning techniques, 2rism enable travelers to identify and 
access detailed information about tourist spots instantly. By utilizing a Convolutional Neural 
Network (CNN) model for image recognition and Logistic Regression for sentiment analysis 
of reviews, coupled with Google Places API for data retrieval, the system provides users with 
comprehensive insights into places they visit. The aim of this research is to enhance travel 
experience by empowering tourists with enriched journeys and fostering deeper connections 
with attractions. Throughout the implementation of 2rism, we seek to improve visitors
satisfaction, revenue generation and destination reputation within the broader tourism industry. 
Ultimately, our goal is to transform the way people explore and appreciate the world, making 
travelling more accessible and enjoyable for all.

## Acknowledgments

We extend our gratitude to all those who contributed to the success of the "2rism" tourism spot 
recognition project. Without the constant support, dedication and expertise of our mentor, team 
members and domain and technical experts, this endeavor within the tourism industry would 
not have reached its fruition. We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the many people 
who supported us throughout this project. First and foremost, we are incredibly grateful to our 
mentor, Sir Dilshard Ahamed, for his guidance and support. His expertise and insights were 
instrumental in shaping our project and keeping us on track. We would also like to extend our 
deepest thanks to Sir Prasan Yapa, our lecturer and module leader, whose continuous guidance 
and encouragement throughout the research process were crucial to our success. And as well 
as Sir Prashan Rathnayake, who provided invaluable support by clarifying our doubts and 
offering valuable feedback whenever we needed it. Our immense appreciation goes out to the 
technical experts who generously evaluated our tourism spot recognition system. Their 
feedback and suggestions significantly improved the overall quality of our project. We deeply 
appreciate the tireless efforts of our fellow team members, whose collaboration and diverse 
skill sets helped us fulfill our objectives. And we extend our heartfelt thanks to our friends and 
family who have been a constant source of support and encouragement throughout this journey.
